# About this fork
Because some users asking me.

We don't pretend to be "The next Etherpad version" because:  
1. First, this fork is made for a specific task. Think like for personal use.  
2. It means, that we tune it for our needs (like removing some buttons, etc). Not too much, but may be noticeable.  
3. Some plugins are made for this specific task (assExport, ponyNamesDecorator, subChecker), and aren't useful for general public.  

But, on the other side  
4. The pad itself has some bugfixes too, including some security and performance fixes.  
5. Some plugins (desktopNotifications, lineNumberLinks, userListEnhancements) can be useful for general public too.  

Conclusion:  
1. This is improved version of ether/pad, which we've made for ourselves.  
2. You are free to use it. You can try to upgrade to this version, and if you you don't like any change - you can track it in commits and revert it.  
3. This version is provided "as is", without any support. Plase do not disturb me with technical questions or feature requests. If you'd like to change something - you can fork it.
